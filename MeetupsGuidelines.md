## PythonNigeria Meetup Guidelines

We get lots of requests from people who want to organize Python Meetups in their cities and schools.
THis guide is written to help meetup organizers effectively plan for their events.

THese are things t be taken into consideration when organising a meetup.

## Speakers
Do a call for Speakers.
Always have somebody as a backup speaker in case all else fails.
If necessary, reach out to outstanding developers/mentors to be speakers at your meet up
Pick a track and stick to it.
If you’re making calls for beginner-related topics, then all selected talks should be focused on beginners only.

Call for speakers should be done at least 4 weeks before the meetup, to adequately review the talks.


## Sponsors
Community projects are best run when there are sponsors. 
When sourcing for sponsors, do not focus on cash only sponsors.
Sponsors could provide as part of / their sponsorship, a venue/meetup space, food and drinks, their organization’s brand items as swag(tech meet ups and swag are 5 & 6).
Also, sponsorship could be in form of Internet access for duration of meetup, publicity for meetup and more importantly, cash to handle logistics    

Look at local organizations tech and otherwise who would sponsor and always make them have the feel that they are sponsoring a genuine cause, they should see it as part of their CSR and alternatively, help them to see that they would gain recognition for sponsoring, also, they could possibly gain talents from the meetup, and recruit developers for various skill level.

 Manage your sponsors
Do shoutouts on social media


 
 Consider other tech meetups
Look out for other meet ups that might likely have a conflicting time and date and would possibly have a negative impact on attendance.
meet up date and time should be planed with this in mind.


Build up the level of the talk progressively and seek feedback
        
 Be data-driven
 Bring the fun!

## Food and…drinks!
Make adequate plan for food/snacks/small chops and also drinks for the meet up based on projected attendance.
I is better to have food and drinks in excess than not having go round.
base food offering should be pastries/small chops and soda drinks. Based on sponsorship, you might decide to up the bar.



## On the day of the Meetup

Have an Agenda for the Meetup
A good agenda for your tech meetup should have detailed information about :
*         Mention if you look for venue/sponsors/talks
*         Which talk is going to be given at what time.
*         Title of the talks
*         Abstract for the talks
*         Bio of the speakers
*         Mention the sponsors


Have volunteers
Volunteers would be responsible for attending to people,
getting people to sign attendance
ensuring order
sharing swags
running logistics
handling social media

2-3 volunteers should be fine


Have an event hashtag. And get attendees to tweet and share pictures on Instagram using the hashtag.
